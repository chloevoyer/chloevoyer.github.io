I usually start off with the quickest elements that will exclude an article, and that are the easiest/quickest to locate.
Most often that is the participant criteria. I will look for `Methods` or `Participants` or `Sample` or sometimes in `Objectives/Aim` and look at the sample and whether or not it meets the eligibility criteria. Usually you can locate this section relatively quickly, as it is often right after the intro (1-2 sentences) and will be the first number that appears in an abstract (usually the sample size or mean age of sample)
This is a good place to find the diagnostic/age criteria is met if applicable (children vs. adults)
Use highlights for search terms if available in your platform!! This will help identify key terms quickly and screen faster!
