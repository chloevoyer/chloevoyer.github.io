  title = {Strengths and challenges to embrace ADHD in employment: A systematic review},
	doi = {10.1177/27546330241287655},
	abstract = {**Background:** Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with psychosocial, educational and occupational functioning. Although often conceptualized as a developmental disorder of childhood, 65\% of children with ADHD continue to meet full or partial diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adulthood and an estimated 4\% of the workforce has a diagnosis of ADHD. 
**Methods:** A systematic review was conducted to understand the experiences of people living with ADHD in the workplace. Articles reporting employment outcomes for people living with were identified by a search in eight databases on four separate occasions from June 27, 2022 to June 21, 2023. Risk of bias assessment for each study was performed using the MMAT. 
**Results:** A total of 79 studies were included in this systematic review (nADHD: 68, 216). Results were synthesized into three broad overarching categories: challenges, strengths and adaptations at work. Further, nine themes were included: ADHD symptoms at work, workplace performance, job satisfaction, interpersonal relationships at work, maladaptive work thoughts and behaviours, personal strengths, embracing ADHD, person-environment fit and accommodations and support. Sex differences were highlighted as a tenth subtheme. ADHD confers both strengths and limitations related to employment. 
**Discussion:** Workers with ADHD can not only adapt but thrive in employment with the right person-environment fit, accommodations and support. Many challenges related to ADHD can be managed or remodeled as assets in a workplace environment that fosters acceptance, flexible working practices and openness to neurodiversity.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are characterized by cognitive deficits, which have been proposed as a transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology (“C” factor). Similarly, cognitive biases (e.g., in attention, memory, and interpretation) represent common tendencies in information processing that are often associated with psychiatric symptoms. However, the question remains whether cognitive biases are also transdiagnostic or are specific to certain psychiatric disorders/symptoms. The current systematic review sought to address whether the proposed “C” factor of transdiagnostic cognitive dysfunction in psychopathology can be extended to cognitive biases. Overall, 31 studies comprising 4401 participants (2536 patients, 1865 non-clinical controls) met inclusion criteria, assessing 19 cognitive biases across 20 diagnostic categories, with most studies focusing on interpretation (k = 22) and attention (k = 11) biases and only 2 assessing memory biases. Traditional meta-analyses found a moderate effect size (g = 0.32) for more severe cognitive biases in all patients relative to non-clinical controls, as well as small but significant associations between interpretation biases and transdiagnostic symptom categories (general psychopathology: r = 0.20, emotion dysfunction: r = 0.17, psychotic symptoms: r = 0.25). Network meta-analyses revealed significant patient versus non-clinical control differences on attention and interpretation biases across diagnoses, as well as significant differences between diagnoses, with highest severity in panic disorder for attention biases and obsessive-compulsive disorder for interpretation biases. The current findings extend the big “C” interpretation of transdiagnostic cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders to cognitive biases and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions. Results also suggest that while the presence of cognitive biases is transdiagnostic, bias severity differs across diagnoses, as in traditional neurocognitive deficits.},

  note={\begin{itemize}
    \item Prevalence of cognitive biases were assessed across 19 biases and 21 diagnoses.
    \item Overall, patients showed more severe biases than controls.
    \item Bias severity was associated with transdiagnostic symptom dimensions.
    \item Network meta-analysis identified variability in bias severity across diagnoses.
    \item Cognitive biases show similar transdiagnostic features to cognitive deficits.

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
