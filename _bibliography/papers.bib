  abstract = {Studying mental health in the context of employment often focuses on individual disorders, potentially overlooking underlying commonalities across different conditions. A transdiagnostic perspective recognizes that certain aspects of job tenure may have broad-reaching implications for employability services that cut across multiple mental health disorders. This scoping review seeks to identify common predictors of job tenure in people living with a mental health disorder from a transdiagnostic approach. The study protocol followed JBI guidelines and was registered on the Open Science Framework platform. The search strategy involved comprehensive searches in electronic databases such as Embase, MEDLINE, and APA PsycINFO. A total of 8,796 abstracts were extracted and uploaded to Covidence for screening. Eligibility criteria will be discussed in the final report. This scoping review aims to highlight predictors of job tenure, such as cognitive and social skills deficits, negative symptoms, scarcity of accommodations, and lack of support inside and outside the workplace, that span multiple mental health disorders. Ideally, identifying predictors will fill gaps in the literature and guide support strategies in order to increase job tenure across diverse psychiatric conditions.},

  doi = {10.1177/27546330241287655},
  abstract = {**Background:** Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with psychosocial, educational and occupational functioning. Although often conceptualized as a developmental disorder of childhood, 65\% of children with ADHD continue to meet full or partial diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adulthood and an estimated 4\% of the workforce has a diagnosis of ADHD. **Methods:** A systematic review was conducted to understand the experiences of people living with ADHD in the workplace. Articles reporting employment outcomes for people living with were identified by a search in eight databases on four separate occasions from June 27, 2022 to June 21, 2023. Risk of bias assessment for each study was performed using the MMAT. **Results:** A total of 79 studies were included in this systematic review (nADHD: 68, 216). Results were synthesized into three broad overarching categories: challenges, strengths and adaptations at work. Further, nine themes were included: ADHD symptoms at work, workplace performance, job satisfaction, interpersonal relationships at work, maladaptive work thoughts and behaviours, personal strengths, embracing ADHD, person-environment fit and accommodations and support. Sex differences were highlighted as a tenth subtheme. ADHD confers both strengths and limitations related to employment. **Discussion:** Workers with ADHD can not only adapt but thrive in employment with the right person-environment fit, accommodations and support. Many challenges related to ADHD can be managed or remodeled as assets in a workplace environment that fosters acceptance, flexible working practices and openness to neurodiversity.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are characterized by cognitive deficits, which have been proposed as a transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology (“C” factor). Similarly, cognitive biases (e.g., in attention, memory, and interpretation) represent common tendencies in information processing that are often associated with psychiatric symptoms. However, the question remains whether cognitive biases are also transdiagnostic or are specific to certain psychiatric disorders/symptoms. The current systematic review sought to address whether the proposed “C” factor of transdiagnostic cognitive dysfunction in psychopathology can be extended to cognitive biases. Overall, 31 studies comprising 4401 participants (2536 patients, 1865 non-clinical controls) met inclusion criteria, assessing 19 cognitive biases across 20 diagnostic categories, with most studies focusing on interpretation (k = 22) and attention (k = 11) biases and only 2 assessing memory biases. Traditional meta-analyses found a moderate effect size (g = 0.32) for more severe cognitive biases in all patients relative to non-clinical controls, as well as small but significant associations between interpretation biases and transdiagnostic symptom categories (general psychopathology: r = 0.20, emotion dysfunction: r = 0.17, psychotic symptoms: r = 0.25). Network meta-analyses revealed significant patient versus non-clinical control differences on attention and interpretation biases across diagnoses, as well as significant differences between diagnoses, with highest severity in panic disorder for attention biases and obsessive-compulsive disorder for interpretation biases. The current findings extend the big “C” interpretation of transdiagnostic cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders to cognitive biases and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions. Results also suggest that while the presence of cognitive biases is transdiagnostic, bias severity differs across diagnoses, as in traditional neurocognitive deficits.},
