- I usually start off with the quickest elements that will exclude an article, and that are the easiest/quickest to locate.
- Most often that is the participant criteria. I will look for `**Methods:**` or `Participants:` or `Sample:` or sometimes in `Objectives/Aim` and look at the sample and whether or not it meets the eligibility criteria. Usually you can locate this section relatively quickly, as it is often right after the intro (1-2 sentences) and will be the first number that appears in an abstract (usually the sample size or mean age of sample)
  - This is a good place to find the diagnostic/age criteria is met if applicable (children vs. adults)
- Use highlights for search terms if available in your platform!! This will help identify key terms quickly and screen faster!

1. **Conference Proceedings:**

- If you see something like

  > [...] **60th Annual National Conference of All India Occupational Therapists Association (AIOTA), (OTICON 2023), February 2-5, 2023** after the main part of the title, then it is also considered conference proceedings

  - Look for keywords like `proceedings`, `conference`, `symposium,`, `meeting`, `workshop`, or abbreviations like `Conf`, `Symp`, `Proc`, followed by a location and date.
  - Examples: _Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on..._ or _Symposium on XYZ, held in..._

- If you see something like this before the title, then it is most often an abstract submitted for a conference presentation (exclude because not peer-reviewed): T50. Or S49 (usually 1 letter followed by a 2-digit number)
  - Indicators in titles or citations, such as `**T50**` or `**S49**` (letter followed by a number), which often denote session numbers.

1. **Dissertations and Theses:**

- Identify keywords like `dissertation,` `thesis,` `Ph.D.,` `M.A.,` or `doctoral.`
- Examples: `Masterâ€™s Thesis, University of...` or `Ph.D. Dissertation, Department of...`

1. **Books and Book Chapters:**

- Look for terms like `chapter,` `section,` `handbook,` `guide,` `edited by,` or `published by.`
- Examples: `**Chapter** 4 in...` or `**Handbook** of Cognitive Science...`
- Most books wonâ€™t have a doi, just an ISSN or ISBN number (unless itâ€™s super recent?)
- Sometimes the title of book or chapters will be very brief and non-descriptive
  - Journal articles are often required to be as specific and descriptive as possible

1. **Non-Peer-Reviewed Sources:**

- Identify keywords like `**editorial**,` `**opinion**,` `**commentary**,` `**letter to the editor**,` `perspective,` or `review` (if not systematic).
- Examples: `Editorial: The Future of...` or `Letter to the Editor regarding...`
- Also non-peered-reviewed sources are manual, guide, list of resources, report, handbook, program

1. **News Articles and Magazine Pieces:**

- Look for publication names that are newspapers, magazines, or other media outlets.
- Examples: `Published in The New York Times`, `Article in Time Magazine...`
- Red flag: articles without a doi (unless itâ€™s a book)

1. **Language and Accessibility:**

- Exclude abstracts in languages not covered by the review unless translation is feasible.
- Examples: `Published in Spanish` if the review only includes English-language studies.

1. **Publication Status:**

- Exclude abstracts with statuses like `in press`, `forthcoming`, or `submitted.`
- Examples: `Article in press`, `Forthcoming in Journal of...`
- If you see an abstract written in the **future-tense** like `we will recruit 50 participants`, or if the title includes `**protocol**`, then it is excluded because it has not data collection (no results published)
  - If you do not see any quantitative data in the abstract, as in results inside brackets, that is also a good indicator (unless itâ€™s a qualitative study). For example: (_M_ = 39.9, _SD_ = 5.9)

1. **Year of Publication:**

- Filter out articles published outside the specified date range of the review.
- Examples: `Published in 1999` when the review covers 2000-2023.

1. **Non-Empirical Studies:**

- Exclude theoretical papers, narrative reviews, or non-empirical discussions.
- Examples: `A theoretical exploration of...` or `Narrative review of...`

1. **Case Studies**

- If the abstract mentions only one participant or `the story ofâ€¦` or `vignette`
- Case studies are often excluded

1. **Recommended Citation**

- If you look at the recommended citation at the end of an article, this might provide more information that could exclude it if you know well citation formatting styles
