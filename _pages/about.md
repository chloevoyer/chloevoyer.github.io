MSc student in Mental Health at McGill University who was awarded 3 scholarships during my first year as a masters student, seeking to pursue graduate research on the efficacy of workplace interventions in adults living with mental illness.

In my research projects, I focus on understanding the impact of psychosocial interventions on individuals with ADHD in the workplace. I aim to provide valuable insights that can contribute to improving the quality of work life for individuals with ADHD.
